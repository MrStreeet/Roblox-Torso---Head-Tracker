**YOU CAN USE THIS IN YOUR GAMES WITHOUT GIVING CREDITS!**

Since I saw a lot of games with this feature, but I didn't saw any Open Source code about it, I decided to distribute my recreation, also with a good optimization of the code, also with a non-delay Server Side feature.

This script it's perfect for RolePlay, Social and also minigames.

You can try this Script without using it by joining my [personal place](https://www.roblox.com/games/8988746798/MrStreeets-Place)

Also, to make it work in ServerSide, don't forge to put the **RemoteEvent** (Rename it to "Look") in the **ReplicatedStore**

*In my place works perfectly, maybe expect some bugs with FOV changings.*

###### Important to know
>Since a year ago I quit coding, so I forget a lot of things because now I'm focusing in other games instead of Roblox, support wouldn't be provided directly but, I will try my best to answer all the issues here on Github.
